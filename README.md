To run the game you need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). You also need to use npm (the Node.js package manager) to install
[Socket.io](http://socket.io/) and [Express](http://expressjs.com/). Then run 'node server.js' in the main directory as
root (or change the port the game serves on) and go to [http://localhost/builder/](http://localhost/builder/) or 
[http://localhost/rescue/](http://localhost/rescue/) in a HTML5-capable browser.

Builder
-------
Use number keys to select buildings and click to place them.
Numbers in top right are (from top to bottom):
* Money
* Population
* Injured Population
* Infected Population

Rescue
------
Your goal is to lead the civilians to the Gardens, where they are evacuated and give you points. Civilians getting infected
and being hit by the infected lose you points, so watch out! You need to work as a team to do well, but you each have an
individual score.
